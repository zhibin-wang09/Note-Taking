            <h4>About</h4>
            <p>Hi, my name is Zhi Bin, I decided to create this extension because as a computer 
                Science student it is often and important that I ask the internet for information. However,
                sometimes there are inconveniences that arise for me during the browsing experience on the web.
                I thought it would be more efficient to use an extension to help me keep track of all the important
                information associated with certain websites.
            </p>
